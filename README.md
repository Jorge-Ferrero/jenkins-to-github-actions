# Jenkins to GitHub Actions – Simple Migration Example

## Purpose
This repository demonstrates how to migrate a classic Jenkins pipeline
(validation, build, test) into GitHub Actions using Groovy and shell scripts.

It is intended as a reference for CI/CD modernization.

## What’s included
- Jenkinsfile example
- Equivalent GitHub Actions workflow
- Basic build & test pipeline
- Dependency caching

## Scope
This example is intentionally simple and represents the kind of
CI pipelines commonly migrated from Jenkins to GitHub Actions
(1–3 jobs, CI only).

## Need help?
I help teams migrate **legacy Jenkins pipelines to GitHub Actions**
through small, well-defined changes.
