# Jenkins to GitHub Actions – Simple Migration Example

This repository shows a **basic migration** from a Jenkins pipeline to GitHub Actions.

## What’s included
- Jenkinsfile example
- Equivalent GitHub Actions workflow
- Basic build & test pipeline
- Dependency caching

## Scope
This example is  intentionally simple and represents the kind of
CI pipelines commonly migrated from Jenkins to GitHub Actions
(1–3 jobs, CI only).

## Need help?
I help teams migrate **legacy Jenkins pipelines to GitHub Actions**
through small, well-defined changes.
